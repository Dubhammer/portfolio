                <p>Carbon Monoxide (CO) is a colorless, odorless gas that is produced by the incomplete combustion of
                    fuels such as gasoline, natural gas, and wood. High levels of CO can cause headaches, dizziness,
                    nausea, and even death. If you are exposed to high levels of CO, move to a well-ventilated area
                    immediately and seek medical attention.</p>

                <p>Nitrogen Dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>) is a reddish-brown gas that is primarily produced by the burning of
                    fossil
                    fuels. Exposure to high levels of NO<sub>2</sub> can cause respiratory issues such as coughing,
                    wheezing, and
                    shortness of breath. If you have a pre-existing respiratory condition such as asthma, exposure to
                    NO<sub>2</sub> can exacerbate your symptoms. Avoid outdoor activities near busy roads and other
                    areas with high
                    traffic to minimize your exposure to NO<sub>2</sub>.</p>

                    micrometers in
                    diameter or smaller. PM<sub>10</sub> can come from sources such as vehicle exhaust, dust, and
                    industrial
                    emissions. Exposure to PM<sub>10</sub> can cause respiratory issues such as coughing, wheezing, and
                    shortness
                    of breath. If you are exposed to high levels of PM<sub>10</sub>, avoid outdoor activities and use
                    air filters
                    in your home to reduce your exposure.</p>

                <h4><b>The Purpose</b></h4>
                <p>If you are concerned about air pollution and its effects on your respiratory health, then this
                    tracker is a valuable resource for you. Air pollution can have serious impacts on respiratory health
                    and can exacerbate conditions such as asthma and bronchitis. Exposure to pollutants such as
                    particulate matter, nitrogen dioxide, and carbon monoxide can cause respiratory issues such as
                    coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath. In addition, long-term exposure to air pollution has
                    been linked to an increased risk of lung cancer, heart disease, and stroke.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h4><b>How it works</b></h4>
                <p>The Air Pollution Tracker provides real-time information on the levels of pollutants in the air in
                    your area, allowing you to make informed decisions about your outdoor activities and take steps to
                    protect your respiratory health. By checking the tracker regularly, you can plan your day and avoid
                    spending time in areas with high levels of pollution. The tracker also offers advice on how to
                    reduce your exposure to pollutants, such as staying indoors when pollution levels are high, using
                    air filters in your home, and avoiding exercising near busy roads.<br><br>

                    Whether you have a pre-existing respiratory condition or simply want to stay informed about the air
                    quality in your area, the Air Pollution Tracker is an essential tool for anyone who is concerned
                    about their respiratory health. With its up-to-date information and helpful advice, the tracker can
                    help you breathe easier and take steps to protect your health.</p>

                <h4><b>The Impact</b></h4>
                <p>Air pollution can have serious impacts on their respiratory health and overall well-being. Exposure
                    to pollutants in the air can cause respiratory issues such as asthma and bronchitis, as well as
                    increase the risk of lung cancer, heart disease, and stroke. In addition, air pollution can also
                    harm the environment and contribute to climate change.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h4><b>Your Action</b></h4>
                <p>Fortunately, there are steps that individuals can take to help reduce air pollution and protect their
                    respiratory health. These include using public transportation or carpooling, reducing energy
                    consumption at home, and supporting policies that promote clean energy and reduce emissions. By
                    working together to address air pollution, we can create a healthier and more sustainable future for
                    ourselves and future generations.</p>
